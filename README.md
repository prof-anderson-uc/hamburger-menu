# Hamburger Menus


A "hamburger" menu is a form of navigation menu that hides navigation links from the main page. When the user clicks an icon, the hidden content will slide into view. 

The hidden menu is marked by the ☰ icon, which consists of three horizontal lines stacked on top of one another—like layers of a hamburger.

The hamburger menu is most often used for mobile apps, but it's also becoming popular on desktop websites, too. It's now often used on responsive sites to make better use of space on smaller phone and tablet screens.
